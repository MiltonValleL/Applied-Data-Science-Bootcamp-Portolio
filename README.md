## 📌 Repository Context & Purpose
This repository serves as a **digital archive of my early work** in Data Science. It contains four comprehensive projects completed as part of an intensive professional training program. 

Unlike my current production-grade work (which focuses on scalable pipelines, custom transformers, and advanced architecture), these projects were developed to strictly adhere to **academic workflows**. They represent the "building blocks" of my technical knowledge, showcasing my ability to:
* Follow a structured Data Science lifecycle (EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation).
* Meet specific business metric thresholds (RMSE, F1-Score, AUC-ROC).
* Utilize the standard Python Data Science stack effectively.

## 🛠️ Technical Foundation
These projects demonstrate competency in the following core areas:
* **Languages:** Python (3.x).
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels.
* **Advanced Modeling:** LightGBM, CatBoost, RandomForest, Logistic Regression.
* **Techniques:** Time Series Decomposition, Class Imbalance Handling (Upsampling/Weighting), Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV), Cross-Validation.

## 💡 Evolution of Code
*Reflecting on these projects allows me to measure my growth as a Data Scientist.*

While the code in this repository follows a linear, instructional "notebook style," it laid the groundwork for my current methodology, which prioritizes:
1.  **Modular Programming:** Moving from notebooks to scripts (`.py`).
2.  **Pipelines:** Using `sklearn.pipeline` for reproducibility.
3.  **Business Logic:** Translating metrics into actionable insights.

Feel free to explore these folders to see the starting point of my journey!
